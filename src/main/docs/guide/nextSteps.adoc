As you have seen in this tutorial, without any annotations you get distributing tracing up-and-running fast with Micronaut.

Micronaut includes several annotations to give you more flexibility. We introduced the `@ContinueSpan`, `@SpanTag` annotations. Also, you have at your disposal the `@NewSpan` annotation which will create a new span, wrapping the method call or reactive type.
